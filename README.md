This zshell script provides a front end allowing users to easily combine (mux) an existing audio media
file with an existing video media file. It interrogates the existing video media file and ensures all
streams within the video media are preservered while importing (muxing) the specified audio media file.

Execute 'ffmux.zsh --help' for further information.
